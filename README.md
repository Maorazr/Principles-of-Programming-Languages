# Principles of Programming Languages

This course studies principles underlying the design of programming languages. It has four main objectives:

- Learning principles of programming languages: elements of programming languages; abstraction means in programming languages;  formal definition of programming languages – concrete syntax, abstract syntax, operational semantics; program correctness –    type checking and type inference systems.
- Describing program execution by studying evaluators: interpreters, transformers and compilers. 
- Comparing programming paradigms: Functional programming, Logic programming and Imperative programming.
- Learning principles of program design: Abstraction, contracts, modular architecture, testing.

# Topics

1. Applied Functional Programming
- Benefits of Functional programming (FP): safety, concurrency, asynchronous code
- Characteristics of FP: pure functions, immutability, higher-order functions, composition
- FP in JavaScript: function, map, filter, chain, flatmap, reduce, zip.
- Types in TypeScript: incremental typing, basic types, interfaces, contracts
- Hierarchical data types: Arrays, objects, JSON
- Higher-order procedures
- Polymorphic procedures: Generic types 
2. Syntax, Semantics, Types
- Concrete and abstract syntax: comparing JavaScript and Scheme
- Operational semantics: the substitution model
- Types: basic types, composite types, type constructors, algebraic data types
- Higher-Order Functions
    - Functions and the processes they generate
    - Anonymous functions, closures, lexical scope
    - Partial evaluation, currying and function composition
    - Primitive and user-defined procedures, derived expressions, special operators 
3. Abstraction on Data and on Control
- Data abstraction: Abstract Data Types (ADTs), Interfaces, Immutable data structures
- ADTs and Algebraic Data Types to model abstract syntax
- From iterators to streams to observables - push and pull data flow
- Control abstraction: Promises and asynchronous programming - reactive programming model
- Coroutines: generators, yield, async and await in JavaScript
- Continuation passing style programming in Scheme
- Tail Recursion Optimization, stack execution model 
4. Evaluators for Functional Programming
- Abstract syntax parser
- An evaluator for the substitution model
- The environment model evaluation algorithm
- Evaluator for the environment-based operational semantics 
5. Type Correctness
- Type checking and inference
- An algorithm for type inference
- Implementing a program transformer: Scheme to Typed Scheme. 
6. Logic Programming
- Relational logic programming
- Logic programming
- Meta-tools: Backtracking optimization (cuts); Unify;
- An evaluator for Prolog
